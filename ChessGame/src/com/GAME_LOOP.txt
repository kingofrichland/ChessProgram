GAME LOOP:
1) DETERMINE THE NEXT PLAYER
2) NOTIFIED NEXT PLAYER TO TAKE MOVE
3) WAIT FOR PLAYER TO TAKE MOVE
4) PLAYER TAKE MOVE
5) VALIDATE THE MOVE
	IF VALID, GO 6
	ELSE, GO 3
6) CHECK GAME END CONDITION
	IF GAME END, GO 7
	ELSE, GO 1
7) END GAME, POST GAME RESULT

Tips:
- Make a thread, do infinite loop by 1 second each time
- For each time, check the state of the game, do the action required for that state
	e.g. IF STATE = 1, THEN NEED TO "DETERMINE THE NEXT PLAYER"
- Those "action" can use Command Design Pattern to encapsulate the actual work
- A class GameLoop should be defined, and should be part of the controller of MVC
